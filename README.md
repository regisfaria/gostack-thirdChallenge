# GoStack Challenge #3

## Overview 
  This repository was made to submit a challenge for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) goStack bootcamp.
  In this challenge, I was asked to reinforce my REST API concepts, creating essential API routes as demanded on the challenge to-dos.

  To run the app, simply insert below command. 
  *Note*: You must install code dependencies before running dev command.(exemple below)
  ``` shell
  $ yarn
  $ yarn dev
  ```

  The api is listening on localhost:3333. 
  To test API requisitions I recommennd using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
