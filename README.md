# GoStack Challenge #3

## Overview 
  This repository was made to submit a challenge for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) goStack bootcamp.
  In this challenge, I was asked to developt a simple frontend with an backend connection. 

  To run the app, simply insert below command. 
  *Note*: You must install code dependencies before running dev command.(exemple below)
  *Note 2*: I haven't uploaded the Backend API here, but you can clone it [here](https://github.com/regisfaria/gostack-secondChallenge);
  ``` shell
  $ yarn
  $ yarn dev
  ```

  Frontend app is running on http://localhost:8080
